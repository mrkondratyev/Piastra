# Piastra2D
A simple code, which solves inviscid compressible hydrodynamics equations within a finite volume framework, using high order Godunov-type methods with TVD Runge-Kutta timestepping. It is written for teaching purposes in Python with an extensive usage of NumPy library.

By now, Piastra2D can solve 1D and 2D compressible hydro equations on a structured uniform Cartesian grid. The solver utilizes a finite volume approach with approximate Riemann solver solution to obtain fluxes of conservative state variables on cell faces. Users can choose between Local Lax-Friedrichs (Rusanov (1961)), Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL; Harten, Lax and van Leer (1983)) and HLLC (Toro et al (1994)) flux functions. To increase the order of approximation in space, the code uses piecewise-linear method with slope limiter (second order of accuracy in space) or Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillating method WENO5 (fifth order in space), as well as Piecewise Parabolic Reconstruction (third order in space). To achieve a better accuracy in time, the code utilizes TVD multistage Runge-Kutta timestepping (methods RK2 and RK3 by Shu and Osher (1988), as well as RK1 with the first order of accuracy in time).
