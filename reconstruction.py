#!!!DESCRIPTION OF rec_PLM!!! 
the function "rec_PLM" below is a python realization of limited second-order piecewise linear method (PLM) for finite volume solvers
it can be done for any system of equations, the input are GRID class object, 2D array of state variable "var" and 
integer "dim" = 1 or 2, which switches between the dimension of reconsturction.
The output is a 2D array with reconstructed state variable at left and right sides of the cell faces 
on the faces of the 2D grid in 1- or 2- dimensions, depending on parameter dim. It applies the limiter function "def limiter"
with several popular slope limiters, that can be adjusted inside the rec_PLM function

The idea of PLM is pretty simple -- instead of using piecewise constant values (just the cell averages)
one can you the piecewise linear extensions in each dimension, using the information from neighbouring cells
to construct the slopes (or the gradients). Further we use the linear function to extrapolate the solution in the cell face by using Taylor expansion.
Unfortunately, the reconstructed profiles can suffer from oscillations (Godunov (1959) theorem)
near the discontinuities of the flow, because the solution's total variation can rise (for linear problems, 
the non-increasing property of total variation of some function corresponds to monotonicity).
To make the scheme monotonic or TVD ("total variation diminishing", as is satisfied for the exact solution of, for instance, 
gas dynamics equations), one has to bound the reconstructed profiles in order to make them monotonic again.
This limiting procedure is done by applying some sort of "limiter" function, which depends on the solution itself.
It is done with monotonicity/smoothness analyzer (van Leer (1974)), which has the form of R = (var(i+1)-var(i))/(var(i)-var(i-1)).
when R >> 1 or R << 1 ==> then we are near the discontinuity, and the slopes should be limited 
when R < 0 ==> then we are at extremum, and the slopes should be turned off to achieve non-increasing of extremum values.
(see P Sweby (1984))

everywhere below the reconstructed value looks like extrapolation in the face from the center of the cell
var_rec(face) = var(cell) + (x(face) - x(cell))*gradient(cell), where for the gradient the limiting is applied.

#!!!DESCRIPTION OF rec_WENO!!! 
the function "rec_WENO" below is a python realization of method-of-lines WENO scheme for 
finite volume solvers with Runge-Kutta high-order timestepping
it can be done for any system of equations, the input are the number of ghost zones NGC, number of cells in desired dimension Nr + NGC, 
2D array of state variable "var" and integer "dim" = 1 or 2, which switches between the dimension of reconsturction.
The output is a 2D array with reconstructed state variable at left and right sides of the cell faces 
on the faces of the 2D grid in 1- or 2- dimensions, depending on parameter dim. 

The idea of ENO (essentually non-oscillating) and WENO (weighted ENO) is a bit different from PLM -- instead of using piecewise constant values (just the cell averages)
we again try to find higher order polynomial extensions in each dimension, using the information from neighbouring cells
to construct the polynomial coefficients. All of the considerations about TVD/monotonicity (see "rec_PLM") stands the same here. 
But here we construct our high order polynomials on different stencils (e.g. in 1D along X-coordinate we can use 3 stencils - left(i-2,i-1,i), central(i-1,i,i+1) 
and right(i,i+1,i+2) for the cell with index i). Further we can find the so called indicator of smootheness (IS below) for each stencil, which show, how strongly the function varies near the cell.
They depend on the coefficients of original reconsturction. For example, if in the cell i+1 we have some sort of discontinuity,
in original ENO we should not use the stencils C and R, but inside the left stencil the solution will still be smooth, so that we can use it for high order reconstruction.  

By chosing the smoothest stencil (ENO) with the smallest IS, or by using the weighted convex combination of different stencils (WENO), we can obtain the reconstructed state on the face.

everywhere below the reconstructed value looks adopts the Legendre polynomial inside the cell along the 1- or 2-dimension
var_rec = = var(cell) + var_x(cell)*x + var_xx(cell)* (x^2 - 1/12), the integral over the cell volume will be var(cell)*Volume.
the var_x and var_xx are just the approximations for the derivatives.
We look for 3 stencils and further use either finite-difference WENO5 scheme for the weights (fifth order in space) of CWENO (C for central) weights, 
which has third order in space.
